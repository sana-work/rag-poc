# Sample RAG Developer Questions

This document contains a list of technical questions designed to test the **Developer Mode** of the RAG application. These questions cover architecture, API usage, deployment, and troubleshooting.

---

## 🔹 A. System Understanding & Architecture
*   **Overview**: What is the overall purpose of the Ops UI and Simulator platform?
*   **Workflow**: How does the Maker–Checker workflow work across entities?
*   **Tech Stack**: Which components use MongoDB, Oracle, and Kafka?
*   **Comparisons**: How does SRDH differ from the Ops UI backend?
*   **Integrations**: What downstream systems does this platform integrate with?

## 🔹 B. API Usage & Development
*   **Hierarchy**: How do I create or update a Hierarchy using the API?
*   **Processing Codes**: What is the approval flow for Processing Codes?
*   **Data Retrieval**: 
    *   Which API fetches pipeline vs active records?
    *   How can I retrieve audit history for a Program?
    *   What are the differences between `/getPipeline*` and `/get*History` APIs?
*   **Transactions**: How do I close an active Transaction Code?
*   **External Systems**: What APIs interact with PISMO for hierarchy data?

## 🔹 C. Data Modeling & Behavior
*   **Validation**: What fields are mandatory when creating a Hierarchy?
*   **Structure**: How are levels represented in hierarchy creation?
*   **Identity**: How does `uniqueReferenceId` work across pipeline entities?
*   **Concurrency**: How is optimistic locking handled?
*   **Workflows**: What happens if an entity is rejected in the pipeline?

## 🔹 D. CI/CD & Deployment
*   **Source Control**: Where are the backend repositories located?
*   **Documentation**: How do I access Swagger for DEV vs UAT?
*   **Infrastructure**: 
    *   What OpenShift namespace is used for deployment?
    *   How do I verify if a backend service is running?
*   **Configuration**: How are environment-specific URLs structured?

## 🔹 E. Logging & Troubleshooting
*   **Exceptions**: 
    *   What does a `MongoSocketReadTimeoutException` indicate?
    *   What causes `ORA-01017` errors and how can they be fixed?
*   **Debugging**: 
    *   How should I troubleshoot frequent `404 NOT_FOUND` errors?
    *   Which logs indicate Kafka consumer failures?
    *   How do I differentiate DB connectivity vs application startup issues?
*   **Severity**: What errors are considered critical vs informational?

## 🔹 F. Access & Security
*   **Access Requests**: 
    *   How do I request Maker access for Ops UI?
    *   Which CMP group is needed for Checker access?
    *   How do I get read-only access to Manual Adjustments?
*   **Roles**: 
    *   What access is required for SRDH Maker vs Checker?
    *   What role is required for high-value transaction checking?
*   **Permissions**: What is the difference between `OPS_UI_VIEW` and `MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT_VIEW`?

## 🔹 G. Feature Development & Enhancements
*   **Patterns**: 
    *   How can I add a new entity following the existing pipeline pattern?
    *   How do I reuse an existing feature to build a new one?
    *   How do I implement a cancel flow similar to existing patterns?
*   **Testing**: What unit tests are expected when adding a new feature?
*   **Localization**: How should i18n changes be handled for new UI components?

## 🔹 H. AI-Assisted Development (Prompt Library)
*   **Visualization**: Generate Mermaid diagrams for the hierarchy approval workflow.
*   **Analysis**: Analyze the admin-division feature and extend it to a new entity.
*   **Refactoring**: Refactor shared logic for pipeline approval handling.
*   **Testing**: Generate unit tests for processing code approval.
*   **Comparison**: Compare manual adjustment flow with account inquiry flow.

## 🔹 I. Operations & Support
*   **Environment**: How can I verify whether an error is environment-specific?
*   **Diagnostics**: 
    *   What logs should I check first when the simulator fails?
    *   How do I diagnose MongoDB replica set issues?
    *   What monitoring signals indicate Kafka lag problems?
*   **Validation**: How do I validate database credentials in UAT?

## 🔹 J. Meta / RAG Capability Checks
*   **Summarization**: Summarize all APIs related to Hierarchy.
*   **Listing**: List all roles required to fully use Ops UI in UAT.
*   **Root Cause**: Show common errors and their root causes.
*   **Lifecycle**: Explain the full lifecycle of a Transaction Code.
*   **Environment Diff**: Compare DEV vs UAT deployment differences.
