 23. What specific actions can a "Maker" perform versus a "Checker"?
 24. What does the status Auth Required mean for a new record (e.g., Branch or Transaction Code)?
 25. Who has the permission to approve compliance-rejected records?

[7. Dormancy & Sanctions]
 26. What logic does Dormancy Configuration control?
 27. What does Target Type = Division mean in dormancy rules?
 28. If Deny = True is set for a dormant account, what happens to incoming transactions?
 29. How are sanction checks enforced across different modules?


PHASE 4: CRITICAL OPERATIONS (HIGH RISK)
----------------------------------------

[8. Manual Adjustments (UETR & Repairs)]
 30. When is a Manual Adjustment strictly required?
 31. What is the UETR (Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference) and why is it critical?
 32. What actions can an operator perform when a record is in "In Process" status?
 33. What does the status Pending Repair indicate?
 34. Why would a Manual Adjustment be rejected for "Sanctions" reasons?
 35. Can a rejected adjustment be resubmitted, or must it be recreated?
 36. How does the system ensure an audit trail for all manual adjustments?

[9. Account Inquiry & Troubleshooting]
 37. What specific data points can be retrieved via the Account Inquiry screen?
 38. What is the maximum date range allowed for a single inquiry?
 39. Which module should be the first step in troubleshooting a failed transaction?


PHASE 5: ADVANCED REASONING (THE "RAG" TEST)
--------------------------------------------

 40. Why can a Transaction Code be active while its linked Branches are still in the pipeline?
 41. Exactly what reference data must be active *before* any transactions can be processed?
 42. What are the specific dependencies between a Branch, a Holiday, and a Transaction Code?
 43. What specific conditions could prevent a manual adjustment from posting successfully?
 44. Why do multiple Programs exist for the same Currency and Country combination?
 45. How does the "Check Time" parameter in Dormancy interact with transaction timestamps?


PHASE 6: OPERATIONAL "FAQS"
---------------------------

 46. Why do many "Active" tabs show "No records found" initially?
 47. Is it expected behavior for a production environment to start with empty reference data?
 48. How can I validate whether data is actually missing or simply filtered out by the UI?
 49. Why is a specific Branch record showing in an Error state?
 50. What does Account Class Type differences imply for reporting?


PHASE 7: SETUP & MODIFICATION PROCEDURES
----------------------------------------

 51. What is the step-by-step process to move an Account Class from "Pipeline" to "Active"?
 52. How do I create a new Processing Code, and what approvals will be triggered?
 53. What is the recommended sequence for creating reference data (which comes first)?
 54. How do I activate a Dormancy Configuration that is currently INACTIVE?
 55. Who is authorized to resolve errors in the Branch pipeline?
 56. Where do I start if I need to onboard a new Country?
 57. How do I search for holidays specifically by division?
 58. How do I identify the Unique Reference ID for an RTCA transaction?
