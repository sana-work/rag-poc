    <h1>Google Gemini: A New Era of Multimodal AI</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Gemini is Google's most capable and general model, built from the ground up to be multimodal. This means it can
        generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text,
        code, audio, image, and video.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multimodality:</strong> Unlike other models that are stitched together from separate components,
            Gemini was trained multimodally from the start. This gives it state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities across
            different modalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Gemini 1.5 Pro features a breakthrough context window of up to 2 million tokens,
            allowing it to process vast amounts of information in a single prompt.</li>
        <li><strong>Coding:</strong> Gemini excels at coding tasks, capable of understanding, explaining, and generating
            high-quality code in popular programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and Go.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Versions</h2>
    <p>Gemini comes in three sizes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gemini Ultra:</strong> The largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Gemini Pro:</strong> The best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Gemini Nano:</strong> The most efficient model for on-device tasks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>Gemini Ultra creates state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large
        language model (LLM) research and development.</p>
