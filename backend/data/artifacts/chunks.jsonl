{"text": "Google Gemini Overview Google Gemini: A New Era of Multimodal AI Introduction Gemini is Google's most capable and general model, built from the ground up to be multimodal. This means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image, and video. Key Features Multimodality: Unlike other models that are stitched together from separate components, Gemini was trained multimodally from the start. This gives it state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities across different modalities. Reasoning: Gemini 1.5 Pro features a breakthrough context window of up to 2 million tokens, allowing it to process vast amounts of information in a single prompt. Coding: Gemini excels at coding tasks, capable of understanding, explaining, and generating high-quality code in popular programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and Go. Versions Gemini comes in three sizes: Gemini Ultra: The largest and most capable model for", "meta": {"sourcePath": "sample_data/gemini_info.html", "docTitle": "gemini_info.html", "docId": "gemini_info"}, "chunkId": "gemini_info_0"}
